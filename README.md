## The reason behind this project

This project was developed as the last optional project of this React course:
https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/section-4-solo-project-co24f49bea8aace7c174082c8.

## Description
Quizzical is a trivia game. I did not use React Router because one of the requirements was not to and also a simple app like this one does not require it. 
I built this project using React.JS and SASS. I also created a SASS module for each of the components in order to keep everything more organized. I did not use any external libraries or add-ons on this project.
